## 🪜 Step-by-Step Guide

### ✅ Step 1: Define the Message

> What are you selling or promoting?  
> Who is your audience?  
> What feeling or result do you want to create?

💡 **Open ChatGPT or Gemini** and type:

```
Write 3 short ad hooks for a digital productivity app. The audience is remote workers. Make it friendly and modern.
```

Example outputs:
- “Tired of calendar chaos? Meet your AI time-saver.”
- “Get your day back. Let AI plan it for you.”

---

### ✅ Step 2: Generate the Ad Script (Text)

Now ask the AI:

```
Write a 15-second video script for a social media ad promoting an AI assistant that organizes your schedule. Keep it casual and include a call-to-action.
```

The script might say:
> “I used to miss meetings and double-book everything. Now? My AI calendar just gets me. Try it free.”

---

### ✅ Step 3A: Create an Image Ad (If you're going for a static visual)

**Tools**:
- [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com) (via Discord)
- [Leonardo AI](https://leonardo.ai)
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com)

**Prompt** for image generation:
```
A clean digital workspace with a glowing calendar on screen, minimal style, soft lighting, realistic, 4K
```

Then:
1. Download the image
2. Open Canva
3. Add:
   - Logo
   - Headline
   - CTA (“Try it Free”, “Boost Your Productivity”, etc.)
4. Export as square (1:1) or vertical (4:5) format

### ✅ Step 3B: Create a Video Ad (Recommended)

**If you want to create a short video ad**, choose one of these tools:

| Tool | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **[Veo](https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/)** | Cinematic HD videos with movement |
| **[Runway](https://runwayml.com/)** | Fast video from text or images |
| **[Pika Labs](https://pika.art)** | Creative visuals, animated styles |
| **[D-ID](https://www.d-id.com/)** | Talking avatars from photos |

**Prompt for Veo or Runway**:
```
A young remote worker sits at a laptop looking stressed. Suddenly, their calendar auto-organizes. Their expression changes to confident. Background music, cinematic lighting. 15 seconds.
```

Then:
- Add music and text with **CapCut** or **Canva**
- Include your brand, logo, and CTA at the end

---

### ✅ Step 4: Final Touches and Editing

**Tools**: Canva or CapCut (free, easy to use)

- Add animated text
- Crop for platform formats:
  - 9:16 for Instagram Reels, TikTok, YouTube Shorts
  - 1:1 or 4:5 for LinkedIn or Facebook
- Make sure it looks good with sound off!

---

### ✅ Step 5: Publish Your Ad

Choose where you want to post:

- 📱 **Instagram / TikTok** – vertical video, fun tone
- 👔 **LinkedIn** – short and sharp with a business tone
- 🎥 **YouTube Shorts** – high visual quality

Use:
- [Meta Business Suite](https://business.facebook.com/) for Instagram/Facebook

## 📈 Optional Step: Improve It

```

AI can help improve your message, test new ideas, and even create variations.
